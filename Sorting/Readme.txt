Sorting is arranging the elements in a list or collection in increasing or decreasing order of some property.

Classification of Sorting Algorithm is based on few properties :-

1. Time commplexity
2. Space Complexity or Memory Usage
	-> In-place sort, constant memory
	-> Memory grows, extra space needed
3. Stability (sequence of similar elements are maintained)
4. Internal sort (all records in main memory or RAM) or External sort (records are on disks or tapes)
5. Recursive or Non-recursive
